`Alchemy` is a new build system based on the one used in Android. A central
makefile instance scans a workspace to find user makefiles, includes them and
register modules to be built. Modules are described by a set of variables
(`LOCAL_XXX`) specifying source files, custom compilation flags, include
directories and some other more advanced stuff.

Modules can be libraries (static and shared), executable, prebuilt binaries of
components built by another build system (like autotools suite for many linux
packages). Build of external modules is similar to what is done in buildroot.

`Alchemy` is hence a mix of what can be done in Android (building source files
without having to write complicated makefile/autoconfo.ac) and buildroot
(building open-source components having there own makefile/configure/cmake)

`Alchemy` supports:

* building static/shared libraries and executables from source code.
* building autotools/cmake from archives or source tree.
* building qmake applications.
* building for linux/ios/macos/android/windows targets.
* building on linux/macos hosts.

`Alchemy` uses gnu make and shell/python scripts to do the job. The
configuration tool is kconfig (as on linux/buildroot/busybox) and prebuilt
binaries are provided on linux/macos hosts.

A first working example is how kconfig binaries are built (see kconfig subdir
and its atom.mk/build.sh)
